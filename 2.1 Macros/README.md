The Macros only work with .MHR on MH. You MUST have Physics bypass AS well as FPS bypass set to the correct amount. Lots are bugged and don't work. Sorry :( 2.1 will no longer be supported

This also contains a GDPS for 2.1! Just extract the folder and run the GD.EXE in the folder!
(You can also downgrade your game or something like that)
