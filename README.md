*So Megahack 2.1 macros will never work with 2.2 so I have moved away from Megahack mainly because the accuracy of the macros were insanely horrible. I spent about 89atts for a good Phobos Macro, but I could never get one that worked. I am now using YBot as it's far more consistent and so far, no macros have broken. If you want Ybot or MegaHack join the discord! `ServerLinkHere`*

##I Plan to boat ever rated level, and put it here


## YouTube Macros
My collection of Macros found in my videos and some others from other people **[Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/@GWDdoS?sub_conformation=1)**.
Feel free to use them just please give me credit and the people that made the macro. 

__Installation(New)__  
  1. Get ybot.
  2. Install a fresh copy of GD. (Make a folder named GDYBOT)
  3. Copy all of the GD files from your steam gd files. Make sure to get the resources folder!
  4. Make sure the copied files do not contain files like "hacker.dll" or something like that.
  5. Go to steam and add an external game. Chose the path to the new GD exe in the folder of GDYBot
